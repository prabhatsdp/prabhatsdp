# 👋 Hi, I’m Prabhat Pandey

I’m a **Lead Mobile Engineer** at [FiatPe](https://fiatpe.com), a fintech company offering innovative **payment solutions for businesses and merchants**.  

With **around 6 years of experience** in Android and cross-platform development, I craft **fast 🚀, reliable ✔️, secure 🛡️, scalable, and maintainable mobile apps** that deliver delightful digital experiences.  

I rose through the ranks at Oodles Technologies — starting as **Associate Consultant - Android**, earning multiple promotions, and ultimately leading as **Lead Mobile Developer**, before moving to FiatPe.  

At FiatPe, I build **Mobile Apps, POS Apps, and Mobile Payment SDKs**, working hands-on with **Kotlin, Flutter, Jetpack Compose**, and more.
